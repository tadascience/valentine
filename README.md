The goal of valentine is to spread the love üíõ about your favourite R
package via ‚Äúroses are red ‚Ä¶‚Äù poems üåπ generated by AI via the
[ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/) üì¶.

## Installation

You can install the development version:

``` r
pak::pak("tadascience/valentine")
```

## Setup

`valentine::roses()` uses a
[Chat](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/Chat.html) object to
communicate with the LLM of your choice. The default value for the
`chat` argument uses the ‚Äúgpt-3.5-turbo‚Äù model from OpenAI via the
[ellmer::chat_openai()](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/chat_openai.html)
which is usually good enough for such a simple task.

Please refer to [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/index.html)
documentation for information on setting up api keys, etc ‚Ä¶

## Example

``` r
valentine::roses("dplyr")
#> Roses are red, violets are blue üåπ
#> But dplyr is the package that makes my data dreams come true üìä
#> With tidyverse magic, it's a joy to explore üí´
#> My love for dplyr runs deep, that's for sure! üíñ
```

``` r
valentine::roses("lubridate", hint = "make it kinky")
#> Roses are red
#> Lubridate's my love, so pretty in red üåπ
#> With its functions so sleek, my data's never misled üíª
#> Date manipulation has never felt better in bed üòâ
```

``` r
valentine::roses("valentine")
#> Roses are red, üåπ
#> Valentine is sweet, üíñ
#> With packages like you, üì¶
#> My coding heart skips a beat! ‚ù§Ô∏è
```
