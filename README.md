The goal of valentine is to spread the love 💛 about your favourite R
package via “roses are red …” poems 🌹 generated by AI via the
[ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/) 📦.

## Installation

You can install the development version:

``` r
pak::pak("tadascience/valentine")
```

## Setup

`valentine::roses()` uses a
[Chat](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/Chat.html) object to
communicate with the LLM of your choice. The default value for the
`chat` argument uses the “gpt-3.5-turbo” model from OpenAI via the
[ellmer::chat_openai()](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/chat_openai.html)
which is usually good enough for such a simple task.

Please refer to [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/index.html)
documentation for information on setting up api keys, etc …

## Example

``` r
valentine::roses("dplyr")
#> Roses are red 🌹
#> Dplyr is blue 📘
#> You make my data wrangling dreams come true 💭
#> Thanks for all that you do! 🙏🏽
```

``` r
valentine::roses("lubridate", hint = "make it kinky")
#> Roses are red, violets are blue 🌹
#> But lubridate, oh how I love you 💕
#> You handle time like no other can ⏰
#> With you, my R code's always so grand 😈
```

``` r
valentine::roses("valentine")
#> Roses are red, 
#> Valentine is true 💕
#> With R package love,
#> I'll always be with you 🌹💖
```
